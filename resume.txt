1.  Introduction

   Hello.  My name is Aaron Levin.  I am a mathematician turned software
   engineer.  I am excited by data-driven opportunities in environments
   that foster creativity, diversity, and innovation.  I value openness,
   honesty, empathy, and egolessness.

   I have experience navigating all layers of the stack.  I am
   passionate about solving challenging problems in functional
   programming, data engineering, Scala, Haskell, machine learning, and
   distributed systems.  If you have an opening, please get in touch!

   *  2006 - 2007
   *  Supervisors: Vladimir Troitsky [1] and Nicole Tomczak-Jaegermann
      [2]
   *  GPA: 3.8

   I accomplished original work in extending the Perron-Frobenius
   theorem on matrices to semigroups of positive operators on infinite-
   dimensional Banach lattices.

2.2.  MSc.  Physics (non-completed) (University of Waterloo)

   *  Specialized in Condensed Matter Physics (High-Temperature
      Superconductors)
   *  2004 - 2005
   *  Supervisor: Thomas Devereaux [3]

   Under the supervision of Dr. Thomas Devereaux I modeled electric
   fields in high-temperature superconductors using Ewald summation [4].

2.3.  BSc.  Engineering Physics (University of Alberta)

   *  Specialized in Computational Physics
   *  Honours thesis: analyzing time-resolved optical properties of
      continuum-generated probe pulses.
   *  1999 - 2004
   *  Thesis supervisor: Frank Hegmann [5]
   *  GPA: 3.8

   During my undergraduate degree I focused on obtaining a strong
   foundation in programming (C, C++, MC6800 Assembly) to compliment my
   studies in theoretical physics.

8.  Hobbies and Self Development

8.1.  Weird Canada / Wyrd Arts Initiatives

   I founded Weird Canada [53] in 2009 to create a space for people to
   enthuse about emerging and experimental Canadian music.  Despite
   Weird Canada's focus on physically-released (often cassette), fringe
   music, the site grew to national acclaim, eventually winning CBC
   Radio 3's "Best Indie Music Website in Canada" award.  After the hard
   work of Executive Director Marie Flanagan [54], the site has over 500
   volunteers, is fully bilingual, ad-free, and has representation in
   every province and territory in Canada.

   I am currently Weird Canada's Creative Director and my main duties
   involve ensuring the site's curatorial vision [55] is maintained
   across the site and our online store Wyrd Distro [56].

8.2.  Intersections KW

   Steven Taschuk [57] and I founded Intersections KW to create a space
   of enthusiasm for pure mathematics, programming languages, computer
   science, and data science.  We've had over eight meetups and hosted

Internet-Draft         Curriculum Vitae // Resume              July 2017


   talks from Christopher Olah and Russell O'Connor on diverse topics
   such as Constructive Logic, Deep Neural Networks, and inventing
   Bezier splines in the age of Archimedes.

8.3.  Vipassana Meditation

   I am a Vipassana [58] meditator as taught by S.  N.  Goenka.  Each
   year I take a 10-day course where we practice silent meditation for
   11hrs. each day.

8.4.  Record Collecting

   For over fifteen years I have been collecting (and sometimes selling)
   used records.  I have focused on independent and privately-released
   Canadian music from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, especially experimental or
   fringe music.

   In 2007, a friend and I found a record by an artist named Lewis [59].
   After many years of champion the strange, unassuming LP within
   underground communities of record collectors, Lewis' album found
   international notoriety for reasons I still don't properly
   understand.  I was even interviewed on CBC's As It Happens [60].
