1.  Introduction

   Hello.  I am Aaron Levin, a mathematician-turned software engineer.
   I am excited by data-driven opportunities in environments that foster
   creativity, diversity, and innovation.  I value openness, honesty,
   empathy, and egolessness.

Internet-Draft         Curriculum Vitae // Resume             March 2015


   The engine behind my enthusiasm resides at the intersection of my
   analytical background (MSc.  Mathematics) and my creative energies
   (writing, design, and development).  Digital media presents a unique
   opportunity to combine deep, analytics processes with, highly-
   creative, user-oriented goals.

2.  Education

2.1.  MSc.  Mathematics (University of Alberta)

   *  Thesis work in Positivity on Banach Lattices
   *  2006 - 2007
   *  Supervisors: Vladimir Troitsky [1] and Nicole Tomczak-Jaegermann
      [2]
   *  GPA: 3.8

   I accomplished original work in extending the Perron-Frobenius
   theorem on matrices to semigroups of positive operators on infinite-
   dimensional Banach lattices.

   The Perron-Frobenius theorem is used extensively in machine learning,
   specifically in Google's PageRank algorithm.  My work empowered
   researches and scientists to use Perron-Frobenius in a broader class
   of Banach spaces.

2.2.  MSc.  Physics (University of Waterloo)

   *  Specialized in Condensed Matter Physics (High-Temperature
      Superconductors)
   *  2004 - 2005
   *  Supervisor: Thomas Devereaux [3]

   Under the supervision of Dr. Thomas Devereaux I modeled electric
   fields in high-temperature superconductors using Ewald summation [4].

   During my time at the University of Waterloo I took a course with Dr.
   Achim Kempf [5] on the mathematical foundations of Quantum Mecahnics.
   This course inspired me to obtain a deeper understanding of Banach
   Algebras and as a result I left my masters program to study
   Functional Analysis.

2.3.  BSc.  Engineering Physics (University of Alberta)

   *  Specialized in Computational Physics
   *  Honours thesis: analyzing time-resolved optical properties of
      continuum-generated probe pulses.
   *  1999 - 2004
   *  Thesis supervisor: Frank Hegmann [6]

Internet-Draft         Curriculum Vitae // Resume             March 2015


   *  GPA: 3.8

   During my undergraduate degree I focused on obtaining a strong
   foundation in programming (C, C++, MC6800 Assembly) to compliment my
   studies in theoretical physics.

   *  url: https://www.metamarketplace.com/

   At Demeure/Metamarketplace I was hired to design and build their data
   infrastructure.  As a B2B marketplace, we were challenged with
   consuming a significant volume of events.  I chose Apache Storm for
   its distributed foundation and multi-language interop.  Events were
   consumed and processed by Apache Storm, indexed in Elasticsearch, and
   stored in DynamoDB.

   Relevant technology:

   *  Apache Storm [17]

   *  Full-stack engineer building a product comparison platform
      empowering consumers to make decisions easier and data-driven.
   *  url: http://sortable.com/

   As a full-stack I helped design, build, and support our product
   comparison platform at every layer: data storage, search, web
   servers, caching, front-end, deployment, and job processing.  Our
   platform crawled the web, indexing tens of thousands of product data,
   which we made available to our users.

   Relevant technology:

   *  Scala
   *  AWS
   *  Elasticsearch
   *  PostgreSQL
   *  Redis
   *  memcached
   *  Python

5.  Relevant Technological Experience

5.1.  Programming Languages

5.1.1.  Quantifying Programming Language Knowledge

   Below is a list of Programming Languages I have used in production.

   Communicating expertise in a programming language is nuanced.  The
   usual metric (number of years of experience) is flawed; it does not
   accurately capture foundational understanding in a language.  Someone
   with three years of experience in a language as a compiler designer
   is going to have a much deeper and foundational understanding than
   someone who has used said language in their career.

   To overcome this limitation, I've created a number of levels and a
   curve to represent an individual's understanding at each level.  The
   scale is Fibonacci, which I chose arbitrarily.

   As one increases level, understanding increases dramatically.

   Level 1:  Have read about this language and potentially written a
             Hello World program.
   Level 2:  Have written trivial programs and am familiar with the
             language's paradigms.
   Level 3:  Can write a trivial program and am familiar with the build
             tools.  Alternatively, this level may include languages I
             may have been proficient in many years ago, but time has
             waned my expertise.
   Level 4:  Can write non-trivial programs and reason about
             performance.  Am aware of some of the major libraries and
             frameworks, though not an expert in their design.
   Level 5:  Can write and maintain large projects in this language.
             Have obtained deeper understanding of runtime and compiler
             nuances.
   Level 6:  Have written and maintained very large projects in this
             language, using a multitude of tools to reason and improve
             performance.
   Level 7:  You are Edward Kmett [25].

8.  Hobbies and Self Development

8.1.  Weird Canada / Wyrd Arts Initiatives

   I founded Weird Canada [41] in 2009 to create a space for people to
   enthuse about emerging and experimental Canadian music.  Despite
   Weird Canada's focus on physically-released (often cassette), fringe
   music, the site grew to national acclaim, eventually winning CBC
   Radio 3's "Best Indie Music Website in Canada" award.  After the hard
   work of Executive Director Marie Flanagan [42], the site has over 500
   volunteers, is fully bilingual, ad-free, and has representation in
   every province and territory in Canada.

   I am currently Weird Canada's Creative Director and my main duties
   involve ensuring the site's curatorial vision [43] is maintained
   across the site and our online store Wyrd Distro [44].

8.2.  Intersections KW

   Steven Taschuk [45] and I founded Intersections KW to create a space
   of enthusiasm for pure mathematics, programming languages, computer
   science, and data science.  We've had over eight meetups and hosted
   talks from Christopher Olah and Russell O'Connor on diverse topics
   such as Constructive Logic, Deep Neural Networks, and inventing
   Bezier splines in the age of Archimedes.

8.3.  Vipassana Meditation

   I am a Vipassana [46] meditator as taught by S.  N.  Goenka.  Each
   year I take a 10-day course where we practice silent meditation for
   11hrs. each day.

8.4.  Record Collecting

   For over fifteen years I have been collecting (and sometimes selling)
   used records.  I have focused on independent and privately-released
   Canadian music from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, especially experimental or
   fringe music.

   In 2007, a friend and I found a record by an artist named Lewis [47].
   After many years of champion the strange, unassuming LP within
   underground communities of record collectors, Lewis' album found

   international notoriety for reasons I still don't properly
   understand.  I was even interviewed on CBC's As It Happens [48].
