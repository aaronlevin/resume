1.  Introduction

   This is the introduction, where I outline my objectives.

   The engine behind my enthusiasm resides at the intersection of my
   analytical background (MSc.  Mathematics) and my creative energies
   (writing, design, and development).  Digital media presents a unique
   opportunity to combine deep, analytics processes with, highly-
   creative, user-oriented goals.

2.  Education

2.1.  MSc.  Mathematics (University of Alberta)

   o  Thesis work in Positivity on Banach Lattices

   o  2006 - 2007

   o  Supervisors: Vladimir Troitsky [1] and Nicole Tomczak-Jaegermann
      [2]

   o  GPA: 3.8

   I accomplished original work in extending the Perron-Frobenius
   theorem on matrices to semigroups of positive operators on infinite-
   dimensional Banach lattices.

   The Perron-Frobenius theorem is used extensively in machine learning,
   specifically in Google's PageRank algorithm.  My work empowered
   researches and scientists to use Perron-Frobenius in a broader class
   of Banach spaces.

2.2.  BSc.  Engineering Physics (University of Alberta)

   o  Specialized in Computational Physics

   o  Honours thesis: analysing time-resolved optical properties of
      continuum-generated probe pulses.

   o  1999 - 2004

   o  Thesis supervisor: Frank Hegmann [3]

   o  GPA: 3.8

   During my undergraduate degree I focused on obtaining a strong
   foundation in programming (C, C++, MC6800 Assembly) to compliment my
   studies in theoretical physics.

4.  Relevant Technological Experience

4.1.  Programming Languages

4.1.1.  Quantifying Programming Language Knowledge

   Below is a list of Programming Languages I have used in production.
   I don't believe years of experience is a good metric for knowledge of
   a programming language.  Instead, I will list my comfort across these
   languages using a Fibonacci scale where each level represents a
   deeper level of understanding.

                   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7

   As one increases level, understanding increases dramatically.

   Level 1:  Have read about this language and potentially written a
      Hello World program.

   Level 2:  Have written trivial programs and am familiar with the
      languages paradigms.

   Level 3:  Can write a trivial program and am familiar with the build
      tools.  Alternatively, this level may include languages I may have
      been proficient in many years ago, but time has waned my
      expertise.

   Level 4:  Can write non-trivial programs and reason about
      performance.  Am aware of some of the major libraries and
      frameworks, though not an expert in their design.

   Level 5:  Can write and maintain large projects in this language.
      Have obtained deeper understanding of runtime and compiler
      nuances.

   Level 6:  Have written and maintained very large projects in this
      language, using a multitude of tools to reason and improve
      performance.

   Level 7:  You are Edward Kmett [12].
