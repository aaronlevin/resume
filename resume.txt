1.  Introduction

   This is the introduction, where I outline my objectives.

   The engine behind my enthusiasm resides at the intersection of my
   analytical background (MSc.  Mathematics) and my creative energies
   (writing, design, and development).  Digital media presents a unique
   opportunity to combine deep, analytics processes with, highly-
   creative, user-oriented goals.

Internet-Draft         Curriculum Vitae // Resume             March 2015


2.1.  MSc.  Mathematics (University of Alberta)

   *  Thesis work in Positivity on Banach Lattices

   *  2006 - 2007

   *  Supervisors: Vladimir Troitsky [1] and Nicole Tomczak-Jaegermann
      [2]

   *  GPA: 3.8

   I accomplished original work in extending the Perron-Frobenius
   theorem on matrices to semigroups of positive operators on infinite-
   dimensional Banach lattices.

   The Perron-Frobenius theorem is used extensively in machine learning,
   specifically in Google's PageRank algorithm.  My work empowered
   researches and scientists to use Perron-Frobenius in a broader class
   of Banach spaces.

2.2.  BSc.  Engineering Physics (University of Alberta)

   *  Specialized in Computational Physics

   *  Honours thesis: analysing time-resolved optical properties of
      continuum-generated probe pulses.

   *  1999 - 2004

   *  Thesis supervisor: Frank Hegmann [3]

   *  GPA: 3.8

   During my undergraduate degree I focused on obtaining a strong
   foundation in programming (C, C++, MC6800 Assembly) to compliment my
   studies in theoretical physics.

4.  Relevant Technological Experience

4.1.  Programming Languages

4.1.1.  Quantifying Programming Language Knowledge

   Below is a list of Programming Languages I have used in production.

   Communicating expertise in a programming language is nuanced.  The
   usual metric (number of years of experience) is flawed; it does not
   accurately capture foundational understanding in a language.  Someone
   with three years of experience in a language as a compiler designer
   is going to have a much deeper and foundational understanding than
   someone who has used said language in their career.

   To overcome this limitation, I've created a number of levels and a
   curve to represent an individual's understanding at each level.  The
   scale is fibonacci, which I chose arbitrarily.

   PL Understanding as a Fibonacci Sequence


                   understanding
                    ^
                  13|                    .
                  12|                   `
                  11|                   |
                  10|                   |
                   9|                  /
                   8|                 ;
                   7|                 |
                   6|                /
                   5|              _/
                   4|             /
                   3|          ._/
                   2|      .__/
                   1|_____/
                   /---------------------> level
                   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7

   As one increases level, understanding increases dramatically.

   Level 1:  Have read about this language and potentially written a
      Hello World program.

   Level 2:  Have written trivial programs and am familiar with the
      language's paradigms.

   Level 3:  Can write a trivial program and am familiar with the build
      tools.  Alternatively, this level may include languages I may have
      been proficient in many years ago, but time has waned my
      expertise.

   Level 4:  Can write non-trivial programs and reason about
      performance.  Am aware of some of the major libraries and
      frameworks, though not an expert in their design.

   Level 5:  Can write and maintain large projects in this language.
      Have obtained deeper understanding of runtime and compiler
      nuances.

   Level 6:  Have written and maintained very large projects in this
      language, using a multitude of tools to reason and improve
      performance.

   Level 7:  You are Edward Kmett [12].
